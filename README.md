# Jupyter Notebook Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook contains an analysis of space mission data. It explores various aspects of space missions, including launch statistics, mission outcomes, and trends over time. The analysis is performed using Python and several libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook consists of multiple cells, each containing code snippets and visualizations. Here's a brief overview of the analysis performed in each section:

1. Data Preparation: The notebook starts with importing the necessary libraries and loading the space mission dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The data is then cleaned and transformed for further analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: The notebook explores various aspects of space missions, such as the number of launches per year, launches per month, launch prices over time, and the dominance of different organizations in the space industry.

3. Mission Outcomes: The notebook analyzes the success and failure rates of space missions over time. It includes visualizations showing the number of failed missions and the percentage of failures over the years.

4. Cold War Space Race: This section focuses on the space race between the United States and the USSR during the Cold War era. It includes visualizations comparing the number of launches and failures between the two superpowers.

5. Conclusion: The notebook concludes with a summary of the findings and key insights from the analysis.

## Technologies Used

The analysis in this notebook is performed using the following technologies:

- Python: The programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: The interactive development environment used for running and organizing the code.
- Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used for handling and analyzing the space mission dataset.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library used for creating various types of charts and visualizations.
- Plotly: An interactive visualization library used for creating interactive and dynamic charts.

## How to Run the Notebook

To run this notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You also need to install the required libraries mentioned in the notebook. Once you have the prerequisites set up, you can simply open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially.

Note: Some cells may take longer to execute due to the size of the dataset or complexity of the analysis.
